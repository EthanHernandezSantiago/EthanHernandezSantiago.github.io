        <h2>User Description Summary</h2>
        <p>For the usability test, I gave the test to two friends (Esme and Ali) and my brother (Alex). The following were the pretest question:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How much expirence of coding do you have?</li>
            <li>When you are trying to learn something, what tools (i.e books, videos, cources and etc) do you find most helpful?</li>
            <li>What are reasons you choose one tool over another?</li>
            <li>Do you just use one tool or a combination of multiple?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>They all said the samething for questions one through 3, but had slightly different ansewrs for the fourth question. For question one, they all answered that they have no prior coding knowledge. I tried to find someone with coding knowledge, but wasn't able to find anyone. To the second one, they all also had the same answer. They all said that vidoes or tools that helped them watch someone do it were the most helpful. For the thrid one, they all said something along the lines that whatever seems most clear or simple to understand was what they looked for. Their answers for the last question were a little different. Esme said she tends to use one, but Ali and Alex said they tend to use more than one. Ali said while he prefers videos, he sometimes uses non-video tools to help him understand things if the video he was using doesn't explain it well enough for him to understand. Similarly, Alex says if he can't find a video over the topic he wants to learn he sometimes uses a non-video tool to learn, but he always tried to find a video guide frist.</p>
        <h2>User Videos</h2>
        <p>All the test are like a minute or two under the minimun time limit, expect for the frist one which is only 23 minutes long. I was going to redo them, but I ran out of time.</p>
