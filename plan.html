        <h2>Scenerio 1</h2>
        <p>John is entrepeneur and recently has been thinking of learning about web development. He knows if he actually took the time to learn then he could possibly get a good job and it he will be avaible to make a website for his own bussiness, if he starts one.</p>
        <p>John has done some basic research and he knows to get into web development he has to learn things like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. He also had install VS Code so he can use it to code. At frist, John was unsure which online course, video, or book to get so he can learn most in the shortest time possible.</p>
        <p>The best source of information for John would be something that cheap (John is unsure if he'll like or will stick to web devlopment so he wants something that he don't have to waste  a ton of money on), simple to understand (John has no experience so it has to be beginner-friendly), has tons of information without being a burden (John wants to learn the most he can), and offers great examples (this would help John understand the material).</p>
        <h2>Scenerio 2</h2>
        <p>Jane is a experienced software developer at a local bussiness in her town. She has been at this bussiness for about 3 years now, and she tries her best to do her job to the absoulte best of her abilities. As of right now, she is a pro at HTML, CSS, Javscript and other languges and topics that she has learned on her freetime or for a bussiness related reason.</p>
        <p>Even though she is highly experienced, she something forget certian things, and has to review it. She usually finds the infomation she finds by looking it up, but it is not effiecnet. She usally has to look through many website or videos to find the information she needs. Also, she always going to different website for similar topics. She believes it would be simipler is she could find the information she needs in one webiste, that also has related infromation. This way, she wouldn't have to look at hundreds of website for each topics she needs to review.</p>
        <p>Jane also hope to find a website that can offer infromation about web development. She is the head of the web development department so it's her responcibilty to make sure everything is up and efficent. By finding a website with more infomation about web devlopment, she could learn new things so she can better help her bussiness.</p>
