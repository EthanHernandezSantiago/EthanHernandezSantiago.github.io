        <h2>Finding From Test 1 (Esme)</h2>
            <p>Esme didn't offer that much feedback about the website, but did say that everything was good and nothing needs to be changed (at <a href="https://youtu.be/OdjWXLgXna8?t=1356">22:36</a> in the video).</p>
        <h2>Finding From Test 2 (Ali)</h2>
            <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=510">8:30</a>, after asking Ali what he thinks of how the page looks he says:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nicely aligned and spaced out</li>
                <li>Offers a ton good information that would help people learn</li>
                <li>It's a creative website</li>
                <li>Good use of colors</li>
                <li>(<a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=740">12:20</a>) Likes how the HTML refernce introduces the topic, gives explames, and have links to get more infomation on a cetain topic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Later, at <a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=1024">17:04</a> he gave the following feedback on one part of the site navagation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>He said it useful</li>
                <li>He didn't notice it until I pointed it out, so he thinks it would be a good idea to do something to make it more noticeable. For example, making it bigger.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then, at <a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=1148">19:09</a>, he when I asked him about the other part of the navagation (the left and right section), he gave the following feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is useful to know where you are at</li>
                <li>When I asked him if they should combine the sections his responce (at <a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=1269">29:09</a>) was that it might confuse some people. He explained that since the left shows just articles, and the rights shows sectioins in the current article, if they were to combine the section, people might thing that they were all seperate articles. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/7KdYNWy-1qY?t=1506">25:06</a>, I tell him how the playground page doesn't show the error in the textbox. I then ask him how he would show the user that there is an error. His reponce is that he would highlight it or underline it.</p>
        <h2>Finding From Test 3 (Alex)</h2>
            <p>Similar to Esme, Alex said that everything was good and the site did not need changes.</p>
        <h2>The Three Questions</h2>
        <p>From these finding, I saw that the website is mostly good, with only one real issue. The real issue is that it does not display error in the code in the demos or in the playground page.</p>
        <p>This means that almost everything else about the site is clear and easy to use and easy to learn from. There are some things that might be changed (like how Ali said it would be a good idea to make that part of the navagation bigger so people can notice it more), but nothing urgent or that would make the website unusable to the user.</p>
        <p>What needs to be done is that the error messages should be implamented and the developer can think about implementing the slight issues with the navagation.</p>
