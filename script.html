            <p>Hello, <strong>USER</strong>, how are you today?  Thank you for agreeing to help me with this assignment. Also, this meeting will be recorded, is that okay? I am going to be conducting a usability test, which will just inform me if the website is good or needs some rework, over the MDN Web Docs website. Have you ever heard of this page? This page is used to learn more about web development. It is full of documentation on all sorts of topics. I am going to ask you to do simple tasks and to answer easy questions. Please answer the question with your honest thoughts and to the best of your ability. I will be writing your responses down. Do you have any questions before we begin?</p>
            <p>I am going to send you a link in the chat, could you please go to the link on your computer and share your screen? Frist, we going to see what you think of the site. Now, please take a couple minutes to look around the site. What are your thoughts on how the page looks? Is everything readable and in a place that makes sense? Is there something you do not like or would change? Is there something that makes the site difficult to use?</p>
            <p>Now, we are going to focus on the website’s navigation. I am going to give you the name of the article, and you are going to be tasked to find that article. To make sure the navigation is easy to use, I won’t be able to help you if you get stuck. You will have five minutes to find the article. Your article is Display Grid. Okay that is all for that part.</p>
            <p>Now, do you see on the left that it shows which article you are on? Do you see that on the right it shows which section of the current article you are in? What are your thoughts on this? Do you like that they split up into two sections? If the right section was removed, would it make navigating the site harder? Great answers. Do you think it would be a good idea to combine both sections? Like, for example, keep the left section the same, but below the part where it says which article you are in, add the information from the right section? Thanks for your answer.</p>
            <p>Next, could you travel to the link I am going to send in the chat? Scroll down until you see the demo section. Now, to test if error messages appear, could you please try to cause errors in the demo? To use it, delete or add text on the left side of the demo. Ok, you can stop now.</p>
            <p>For the next part, can you please look at the this part of the navagation I am pointing to on my screen? This thing helps a user know where they have gone before. Do you think this is useful? Do you think it clearly shows which way it goes? Is it in a good place and noticeable?</p>
            <p>Ok, we are going to test for another error. Can you please go to the where it says “Play” on the top of the screen? Try to cause an error here. Once again, you'll have 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Do you think there is enough spacing that everything is clearly seen and not clustered? Do you think everything is easily visible. </p>
            <p>My last question for today is: Now that you are more familiar with this website, what are some things that could be improved? Please be specific. Good answer.</p>
            <p>With that, we have completed the test. Thank you for all your help and your amazing feedback. Hope you have a good rest of your day!</p>
