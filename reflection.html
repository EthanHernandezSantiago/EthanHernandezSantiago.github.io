        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>I have learned a lot after doing the tests. This assigment has helped learn about how to create, write, plan and preform a usability test. It also taguht me the importance of it all. Also, while this isn't the frist time I learned or used them, practicing evalating a website over their use of the ten heurstics was really helpful. This project helped me practice this skill so next time I do this, I can do it better.</p>
        <p>Another things I have learned is how my view is biased. Before doing assigment, I never realized the importance of this. Since I all ready know about this stuff, my view is biased. Making a user look over the website will not only show what a real user will notice, but also they might notice things I might not. For example, on the left and right sections of the navagation, I would have never though that some users might think they are seperate article if Ali had not brought it up.</p>
        <p>I have also learned about other tools used to test a webiste. For example, before doing this assigment, I never knew about personas and their use. Now I know that they can be used to better understand the websites users. Some more tools I learned about are pretest and posttest questions. I learned about their importance.</p>
        <p>This will definialy help me later in my career becasue it has changed how I view and think on designing webiste. I can then apply what I learned and design better and more user friendly websites.
        <h2>Final Thoughts on Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>My final thoughts on usability testing is that it is an important topic in web development. It is a super great tool to help design websites that user can easily interact with. This benefits both the designer and the user: users get a more easiler interface, and it can bring more users for the developer. While it is an interesting and important topic, it really isn't for me.</p>
